While copying the rt6_info we reinitialize the\nmetrics store by copying it over from the parent thus invalidating the\njust installed pmtu update (both dsts use the same key to the inetpeer\nstorage). The dst_entry with the just invalidated metrics data would\njust get its RTF_EXPIRES flag cleared and would continue to stay valid\nfor the socket.\n\nWe should have not issued the pmtu update on the already expired dst_entry\nin the first placed. By checking the expiration on the dst entry and\ndoing a relookup in case it is out of date we close the race because\nwe would install a new rt6_info into the fib before we issue the pmtu\nupdate, thus closing this race.\n\nNot reliably updating the dst.expire value was fixed by the patch \"ipv6:\nreset dst.expires value when clearing expire flag\".\ndiff --git a/net/ipv6/route.c b/net/ipv6/route.c\nindex f54e3a101098..04e17b3309fb 100644\n--- a/net/ipv6/route.c\n+++ b/net/ipv6/route.c\n@@ -1090,2 +1090,2 @@ static struct dst_entry *ip6_dst_check(struct dst_entry *dst, u32 cookie)\n-\tif (rt->rt6i_node && (rt->rt6i_node->fn_sernum == cookie))\n-\t\treturn dst;\n+\tif (!rt->rt6i_node || (rt->rt6i_node->fn_sernum != cookie))\n+\t\treturn NULL;\n@@ -1093 +1093,4 @@ static struct dst_entry *ip6_dst_check(struct dst_entry *dst, u32 cookie)\n-\treturn NULL;\n+\tif (rt6_check_expired(rt))\n+\t\treturn NULL;\n+\n+\treturn dst;\n\nAnswer: ACK\n###\nPatch: \"\"\"{}\"\"\"\nAnswer: "
