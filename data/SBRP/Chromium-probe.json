Also  this code isn't very robust -- it's easy for other code to cause black omnibox problems. I'm hoping to both fix this issue  and perhaps add an OnActivate() handler that will either get called when we're really getting activation  or else get called if someone else changes activation in response to their own OnActivate() call; either way I can probably make the omnibox robust against blackness  although in the first case I won't be able to make it completely flicker-proof.

That one is  quot;handle tagged images quot; and this one is  quot;convert the resulting picture to the monitor color space. quot; They don't necessarily have to be fixed at the same time. Ideally  everything would be converted to the monitor's color space. But that may not be possible given that windowless plugins like to draw on our DC and use sRGB  and if a designed specifies color #208000 in both Flash (as an example plug-in that does this) and on their page  they expect the colors to match. As a result  I suspect the only way to make this work will be to use an sRGB backing store. In which case  we should convert from sRGB to whatever the current monitor profile is when we draw to the screen. The downside is that if you're one of the few people that has an AdobeRGB monitor and you are looking at one of the few AdobeRGB images on the web  the gamut will be clamped to sRGB (but for most images you wouldn't notice). One danger is that some people have accidentally assigned incorrect profiles to their monitor  and since they don't run color managed applications  they will think Chrome is broken. This blog post: http://bholley.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/so-many-colors/ talks about some of this with Firefox.

On systems with slow disk seek times  low free disk space or already highly fragmented drive  the whole system performance hit can be quite important. Fix: - Implement the algorithm discussed in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa363911(VS.85).aspx - This could be used for disk cache too. Caveats: - The algorithm to fix this is relatively sensitive. Badly implemented  it can cause more harm than good. - This shouldn't not be done on flash-based drives. Maybe measuring the seek time could help detect and skip these drives. - This requires administrative privilege. On restricted user account  this would not be executed.

This way users can get tricked into executing arbitrary JavaScript on whatever domain is currently loaded in the active tab when clicking on the bookmarked link. A simple example on how to leverage that fact is to sniff the content of  quot;chrome-resource://new-tab quot; \u9225?which usually would show the personal homepage. Given the history function of that page you could scan frequently used pages of that user (and potentially sniff URL parameters like sessions or password). Example (drag to bookmarks bar  click on homepage):  lt;a href= quot;javascript:alert(document.body.innerHTML) quot; gt;drag lt;/a gt; A more complex example would be a script that really forwards to a destination  dragging a linked logo of news site or such into the bookmarks bar will be a frequently used feature for dragging bookmarks.  lt;a href= quot;javascript:if(false){}else{document.location='http://news.google.com' } quot; gt;Google News lt;/a gt; The if statement could for example sniff for a certain domain and than interact with the website (e.g. to steal session or modify data). The example below interacts with the DOM of blogger.com when you are on your homepage \u9225?in all other cases it forwards to new.google.com:  lt;a href= quot;javascript:if(document.location==' http://www.blogger.com/home'){alert (document.body.innerHTML)}else{document.location='http://news.google.com'  gt;Google News lt;/a gt; A user might never realize that every click on the bookmark carries the risk of running malicious code on the open website. Mitigating factors: 1. The risk of getting such a bookmark(let) installed is relatively low  although social engineering tricks might work well on such a simple task like dragging a link. 2. The tooltip of the bookmark shows that it is a JavaScript URL. Not that anybody who would fall for this trick would really understand what that means. Internet Explorer 7 does not allows dragging of JavaScript URLs  it even generates a warning message when you try to add a javascrip: URL via a context menu.

Steps: 1) Client A and B - both are connected to sync using same account 2) A had lots of bookmarks (around 200)  then both clients got the change and they were in sync. Then I just kept moving various bookmark folders from parents to children and vice versa from another client. 3) I saw that sync was working fine for long time and got couple of crashes as I was making these conflicting changes. Chrome restarts fixes the crash issue and sync works fine  but once I got chrome in stuck state  there was no way out  no matter what I do. Actual: Eventually Both clients got into UnSynced State (i.e. Bookmark Models are different and they are not syncing with each other anymore). about:sync falsely claims to be in READY state on both clients but 'Invalid Store' was found TRUE  which seems like an error state to me. Expected: Chrome should not crash due to conflicting changes. Also  Sync should not get into wrong state eventually where it can't make any progress. Note: I tried restarting Chrome on both clients but Sync was in same stuck state. No changes are getting synced from both clients. This bug is very difficult to repro and also doesn't represent normal/common user scenario   so I think it's not that severe of a bug.

There is one known issue with the current implementation. The prototype of multiple profiles works by using the user-data-dir functionality. We create sibling folders of the  quot;User Data quot; folder for new profiles. Example: User Data User Data-Munjal User Data-Finnur User Data-Scott This assumes that the original user data folder name is  quot;User Data quot;. This is fine for Chrome installs  but is not fine when the user data folder doesn't start with the expected prefix. For e.g. in tests  or installs where this behavior is changed.

It looks to be one of his gmail tabs. He notes that he had an unanswered IM in the gmail tab for a few days  so the username would flash in the tab title. Not sure if that has anything to do with it. I've attached his /proc/15159/maps file which he cat'd out for me. It's got a ton of huge anonymous mmap regions. I don't know where these guys are coming from...v8 perhaps? I also see lots of mmap regions without any permissions. Sometimes these regions are 4MB  or 64MB or what not. It seems strange that we have so many of them and they're so large.

Observe the memory consumption (Working Set) rising every second  ? Memory usage should stay at the same level  since the document loaded with XMLHttpRequest replaces itself every time.  ? Memory usage keeps rising. It will keep rising at least up to 1GB  at which point I decided to abort the process. I don't know whether it is a leak or fragmentation or an unexpected reference somewhere that prevents the memory being reused.     I let  quot;TableRefresh.html quot; and  quot;table.xml quot; be served by an Apache server on my local development machine. Any web server should work  as long as  quot;table.xml quot; is served with an XML mime type (text/xml or application/xhtml+xml). The speed at which memory usage increases is determined by the amount of data loaded  see attached  quot;tablegen.py quot; to generate different size tables. If you comment out the entire contents of the  quot;if (req.status == 200) quot; block  memory use still increases with every request  although much slower than when replacing the table. This suggests that the XMLHttpRequest itself is the cause of at least some the memory consumption.

The Google Chrome browser generate object windows continuously there by affecting memory of the resultant system. User interaction is required to visit the malicious page.

This \u9225\u6e07eature\u9225?really annoys me big time. Every time that I try to select a word in an edit field in Chrome 2.0.172.2  it switches to RTL and everything goes haywire (and why is the period at the wrong end of the sentance?) Worse  this feature does not have any significant notification  like a popup that tells the user WTH just happened and why (with the option of no longer notifying them once they understand). It just happens out of the blue and looks like a heck of a bug. Further  there does not seem to be any what of changing the hotkey from Shift+Ctrl (a poor choice to begin with). At this point I have become afraid to select text in edit fields or even press Shift or Ctrl in Chrome because I keep worrying that the text will switch (although since I managed to find a 3rd party blog that explained what was happening  I am now less scared since I understand what\u9225\u6a9a happening and how to fix it).

The dump accumulates on the slaves without never being looked at since the pdb are usually stale anyway. Solution: Instead  each unit test should setup its own instance of breakpad to dump the stack trace in stdout when not under a debugger. Stack traces is much more useful than memory dumps to that regard since 'at least they're on the buildbot stdio logs' for the try slaves  won't work for continuous build because symbols aren't always copied over. crash_service is windows-only but the proposed implementation is platform agnostic. Implementation: Grab the guts that initializes breakpad out of crash_service.cc and into base/test_suite.h. Most tests will get it free since chrome/test/ui/ui_test_suite.h #include chrome/test/unit/chrome_test_suite.h which #include base/test_suite.h. UITestSuite::LoadCrashService() needs to be removed. Fix StackTrace to print out of process exceptions. Summary: Don't save memory dump  instead just print the stack trace with StackTrace.

FEATURE REQUEST--N/A     I'll try to stick to the template recently suggested on this discussion board. For reference  a similar feature exists in Firefox. FEATURE: I would like to see it become *easier* to create  quot;keyworded searches quot;. I am using the term  quot;keyworded search quot; to mean any keyword that is created such that one may type:  lt;the keyword gt;  lt;a search term gt; into the browser bar causing a search of some website using the sites already implemented in search/indexing. For example  I might type: cmu machine learning to initiate a search of Carnegie Mellon's site for machine learning  assuming I set up the keyword appropriately. It *is* currently possible to do this in chromium  and so I am not requesting this feature  but rather an *easier* interface for creating such keywords. To set up the Carnegie Mellon search exampled above  one would have to use chromium's  quot;edit engines quot; window and create the keyword  quot;cmu quot; with the URL: http://web-search.andrew.cmu.edu/search?entqr=3 amp;entsp=a amp;sort=date%3AD.. . with the carefully placed  quot;%s quot; at the end to for the search term. Figuring this URL out might require a bit of tinkering and effort beyond that of most users. However  this is not how I went about creating it. Rather  in firefox  I simply right-clicked the search box on CMU's frontpage and chose the option  quot;create keyworded search quot;. Firefox takes care of inspecting the element and the form of which it is an element. It requires little work on the part of the user. I would like to see a similar feature for chromium. USES: This feature makes accessing non-built in  quot;searches quot; from the browser bar much easier. Examples include searching school/institution pages and other third party and perhaps restricted access sites that have implemented there own/modified search interface. CMU's is actually a dressed up google site search  but in the case of other sites that have a restricted access  it may be favorable or more comfortable to use the  quot;built in quot; search. IMPLEMENTATION: The URL required to make the appropriate post to the respective server can be deduced by inspecting the element and the form in which it resides. If I was not a full time student  I would implement this myself  but I simply don't have the time.

Every quote became slash-prepended (as in JavaScript syntax)  but HTML does not support this kind of things (like the bookmark importer does not). Changing the outer attribute quotes (href= quot;... quot;) to a single quote (href='...') makes Chrome not import the bookmarks. Also note - the spell checker says  quot;prepended quot; is not a word  it suggests  quot;perpended quot; (and others). When searching for  quot;perpended quot; Google suggests it should be  quot;prepended quot;. Am I right? Are Google and Wikitionary (and others) wrong?
