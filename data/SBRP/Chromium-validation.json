GetLooseValues() and program() already returns wstring. Tasks: - GetSwitchValue(wstring) and HasSwitch(wstring) should be deleted. - StringType should be removed and replaced with string16. - GetSwitchValueASCII() should be removed. - AppendSwitchWithValue(string  string) should be removed. - command_line_string() should return a string16 string. - Add POSIX specific interfaces to get the unformatted string. - Add caching of the conversion on POSIX/Mac instead of doing it constantly. On mac and Windows this is a no-brainer as they use utf-8 and utf-16. On other platforms  it depends on LC_/LANG or whatever they feel like to. Since we don't plan to support opening files with non-valid character in them  I don't think we should support esoteric mixed-encoding file paths either. BIG WARNING: The switches name would stay ASCII due to the above note. The reason for this change is that this assumption is already done in code that uses CommandLine arguments so it's better to move the assumption at a single place. At the same time  the CommandLine interface shouldn't be dependent on the OS anymore. Note that the command_line_unittest.cc file as *no* non-ascii character in its test  this bug is about fixing that too to exhibit any deviant handling. cc'ing Evan in case he has an opinion against  cc'ing Drew since he added StringType.

We can't always do the former on the Mac because the plugin needs to end up in the bundle running the tests  which would create bad dependencies if done in the build process  so we probably want to do the latter to be consistent everywhere. See http://codereview.chromium.org/503029 for some background/discussion. It wouldn't hurt to do some refactoring for getting the plugin directory as part of that  so we don't have duplicate path construction code (which varies between Mac and Windows/Linux). ",

This can cause scripts that work fine in IE to behave differently in Chromium/Firefox  resulting in non-functional configuration. For example  the  quot;myIpAddress() quot; PAC library function may return an IPv6 address in chromium/firefox. Whereas in in Internet Explorer it will only returns IPv4 addresses. (Similarly for other functions with DNS resolving dependencies: dnsResolve()  isResolvable()  isInNet()). Since existing scripts written for IE don't expect IPv6 addresses to be returned  when one is  it may pass through the wrong codepath and things won't work. This is a known issue in Firefox (try searching for  quot;ipv6 myIpAddress pac quot;). Here is a thread where users describe hitting it: http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php? locale=tr amp;comments_parentId=259063 amp;forumId=1 Internet Explorer has worked around the problems with the PAC standard by defining the existing functions to be IPv4-only  and adding extensions to support IPv6: http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/07/18/IPV6-WPAD-for-WinHttp-and-WinInet.aspx I think that we should similarly to IE and define the old PAC functions to be IPv4 only  since there are clearly users hitting this problem. Currently the only workaround for Chrome users is to use the --winhttp-proxy-resolver flag. (If we had a flag to disable IPv6 that would work too). ",

Zoom in (view menu) 2. Zoom out (view menu) 3.  ? Zoom in or out of webpage with flash embedded and track cursor in flash window  ? The cursor is offset from action in the flash window. The cursor still tracks fine in the html portion of the window. When rolling over the flash window  however  the cursor hot zone is offset from the actual cursor location.     Especially problematic with programs like Workamajig that auto size the flash content to the page. When the cmd+ or cmd- is accidentally hit there is no physical change to the content but the cursor tracking is offset. I have found the work-around is to put the page back to  quot;Actual Size quot; or cmd 0. This resets the flash content. That took a while to discover. One more detail I noticed is the flash plug saves the zoom information for that page despite deleting all cached data from the preferences menu. A good example page that loads with auto size is this one: http://www.freegames.ws/games/boardgames/mahjong/freemahjong.htm This is a good page to see the effects of the zoom/offset problem. Open the page and zoom in  you will notice the cursor offset but no change in content size. Then close all windows. Clear ALL browsing data  open a new window and load the mahjong game again. You will notice it still offsets the cursor. Thanks for a great browser. I'm glad I could contribute to the BETA.

Currently we use the built-in store. Recently I've brought the code we had for the other two stores back into working order  but it remains to decide how to choose between the available options. At first glance it seems like we should use GNOME keyring on GNOME  KWallet on KDE  and the built-in store otherwise. However  switching between desktop environments would then cause you to have multiple password stores  and access to only one at a time depending on the desktop environment. There are a number of questions to work out: * Should we allow the user to choose the store to use (e.g. between  quot;current environment quot;   quot;gnome quot;   quot;kwallet quot;   quot;built-in quot;) with either some new UI or with a flag? * Should we have some way to migrate passwords between stores  especially from the built-in store to one of the other stores when that first becomes an option? * Should we remember if any store has saved passwords  and always try to use that one? (In that case  how does the user force a different store?) * Should there be some UI to warn when the unencrypted store is in use  e.g. an infobar or icon/text in the passwords and exceptions dialog?

Start two instances of Chrome with two different --user-data-dir folders. 2. Enable sync on both clients. 3. On one client  create a folder and under it create about 30 other elements (either bookmarks or folders). 4. Make sure the changes were propagated to the other client. 5. One either client  delete the top level folder created in step 3. What is the expected output? The deletion should propagate to the other client right away. What do you see instead? The change doesn't propagate right away. The only way to see the change propagating is to create another item (bookmark or folder) on the second client. The problem is likely related to the fact that the first client sends the nudge to the second client before the server finishes the deletion (the deletion is done asynchronously and it takes longer than the amount of time it takes to delete only one item). The way to fix this without involving any server changes is to send the nudge from the first client after verifying that the server is done with the deletion. This can be done by doing a GetUpdates in a loop until the server returns the deletion of the corresponding items. ",

It drives me crazy that right now these results are basically sorted in chronological order instead of by typed count/visit count like the HistoryURLProvider; I have a particular URL in mind I keep trying to get to but other more recent pages keep popping up instead. The sorting and relevance calculation code in the provider is weird. It marks relevance (based on the order in which we get the results) before it compares matches by visit time. Somebody needs to take a hard look at it and clean it up. ",

Visit the Wikipedia pages mentioned above  in separate tabs in the same browser 2. Compare the text appearance between the two tabs  ? Text appears similar in the two pages. The .../Thompson_shell page renders exactly as I'd hope.  ? Text in .../Rc is smaller and somewhat squidgy; text in .../Thompson_shell is a little larger  and matches my expectations. I /think/ that  technically  the Thompson_shell text is lightly hinted and the Rc text is medium or fully hinted. Light hinting is my configured preference.     Hitting C-+ to `zoom in' makes the text appear the same (at least to my untrained eyes) in both tabs. (You only need to hit it once  because the zoom setting is per-hostname.) C-0 resets to the default zoom  and the difference is apparent again. I've collected a fair amount of data. In particular: * I've set my default fonts to Bitstream Vera Serif/Sans Roman 13. * My ~/.fonts.conf is rather weird  so I've attached it. Both it and my Gnome configuration agree that fonts should be lightly hinted. * Because Wikipedia pages are volatile  I saved the pages (attached). Apart from three PNG files present in .../Rc but not in .../Thompson_shell  the ancillary files are identical in both cases. It is therefore not the case that the server provided different style files. * I captured style information from a segment of body text in both pages  using the element inspector. I opened the `Computed styles' box  and copied-and-pasted the entire text (including `inherited' styles) into a file  for each page. The two resulting files are byte-for-byte identical. I gathered together all of these things into a single zipfile. It contains: * dot-fonts.conf: my ~/.fonts.conf file  renamed so it isn't hidden. * rc.html  rc_files/*: A saved copy of the ../Rc page and its ancillary files. * rc.style: My copy-and-paste of the inherited styles for a portion of affected body text in the .../Rc page. * rc.png: A screen-capture of Chrome rendering the .../Rc page. * sh.html  sh_files/*  sh.style  sh.png: Corresponding files for the .../Thompson_shell page. things.zip 597 KB  nbsp; Download ",

Blocked on: issue 35793  nbsp;   feldst...@chromium.org    Currently if you update linux the bookmark manager (and anything else using the shared resources) will stop working  similar to the inspector. Some possible solutions can be found in the comments here: http://codereview.chromium.org/1564034/show - We are going to have to address the issue of upgrading on Linux. These files aren't in a .pak file so they will change during an upgrade and possibly break currently running Chrome instances. We should put them in a pak file and have a mapping between URLs and resource IDs. This will have the side benefit of being not touching disk as much. This can happen in a follow up change. -It might also be possible to do some automapping between filenames and resource ids. We do something like that for theme resources. We can modify grit to generate a header file with the mapping. ",

We need a way for the Http cache to expose this to the rest of the world :) The issue is that currently there is no way to access a particular http cache entry: a network request simply asks for data and the cache locates / creates an entry  reads / writes to it and closes the entry automatically. A possible solution is to create some sort of unique identifier at the http cache level (and return it with the response) so that at a later point a client of the cache can just request data to be read / written to the same entry that was used to fulfill the original request. The time-stamp for the creation/overwrite of the entry may be enough. In case that two entries for the same url share the same time-stamp (a fast create / doom / create sequence)  the actual content of the entry should be the same (unless the server also modified the response within the timer granularity of the client!) so even if the metadata is set to the wrong entry  it will be set to the right  quot;resource quot; (because in this case it will be associated with the newest entry  as opposed to a doomed one).

My initial guess is that http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/55675 is wrong. Another possibility is that we should be calling FrameView::scrollPositionChanged() at some point  which is how the patch in r57971 seems to have been trying to fix it. I don't know which is right. Since this is on the 375 branch and could lead to incorrect painting in some circumstances (like on the tests) marking as P1 pending further investigation. ",

Sub list is accessible  ? Sub list vanishes. The issue as far as I can tell is that the positioned sub list has been placed just slightly outside the area of the parent list item. This is most likely a font-size related rounding issue as the parent is inline and font sized and the two are in fact side by side. However  no other browser messes this up  not even Safari 4 which is using an only slightly older version of Webkit. Furthermore  going to a similar list on a working website and using ctrl-+ to enlarge the font eventually yielded a huge font with a 1px gap below. In Chrome  this 1px gap was sufficient to trigger similar behaviour. Interestingly it was not in Firefox which continued to maintain the hover. Since Webkit nightly is also broken sounds like some sort of regression to me. I will file a Webkit bug as well and try to work up a testcase. ",

This means that  depending on the flags passed to chromium's configure  there will be more or less support for videos. The problems are: - Fedora (and a number of other distributions) can not ship with MPEG-4 video support builtin because of patent problems  making the code essentially  quot;non-free quot; - ffmpeg does not support plugins  thus making it impossible to split out the support for MPEG-4 (and allow users to get just that part from third-parties) I already have support for MPEG-4 videos on my systems through additional GStreamer plugins (whether based on ffmpeg or proprietary software provided by Fluendo  or handled through my computer's GPU).

Restore a complex session windows (66 windows  400-600 tabs) on a single core Prescott IV CPU over a DSL line. 2. Wait 15-20 minutes with ~100% CPU activity and 100%  more quickly trailing of to zero network activity. 3. Examine the session. CPU activity remains moderately high ( gt;60%) while network activity is moderately low.  ? Restore session should work completely and CPU activity should fall back to ~30% (perhaps average for large sessions where chromium has not optimized the use of the gtk poll() functions and/or the use of Javascript in inactive tabs/windows to minimize CPU use and power consumption).  ? Examining the tabs one by one indicates that most are fine. However some tabs  perhaps 5% still have active spinners  some with what appear to be complete pages  some blank (no content)  a couple with messages in the corner like  quot;waiting for cache... quot; or  quot;waiting for www.google- analytics.com quot;. One can reload the web pages by hand and they usually load quite quickly. However  if one hits the X to stop the load  particularly if it is the last spinning tab  may completely hang the browser. It becomes completely unresponsive to keyboard or mouse commands and all of the display windows go blank (unredrawn if you switch away from them and then back to them). attempting to strace the primary process yields no activity (in a normal chrome there are lots of gettimeofday  poll calls  etc). In my opinion this is a fundamental problem (not being able to restore a browser session).     It is possible to restart the session if one does the following things: 1) Start the session w/o javascript  e.g.  quot;-disable-javascript quot;. Many of the tabs use some Javascript  a few probably use it extensively. This is highly undesirable as it means one cannot use normal gmail in the session. 2) Disable Flash (either by removing all libflashplayer.so files from chrome plugin directories) and/or installing the flashblock extension. The net effect of these two things appears to make more CPU time available during the restore to respond to network I/O  display the pages by interacting with the X server and COUGH  spin the !#@%% amp; spinners. This allows more of the servers to complete the sends to the client and properly close the channel. Chrome finishes displaying the pages  and terminates the spinner. But if the servers close the channel (because they think the browser has died) then chrome will hang on the channel forever (burning up useless electricity until it is rebooted). So problem #1 is chrome needs more intelligence or better intelligence to detect when the server has deprioritized it or closed the channel completely. In these cases the only solution is for chrome to attempt a manual (self-induced) reload. This needs to be somewhat intelligent to understand when the delays are due to a saturated network. and when they are not. This problem could get very bad for someone attempting to reload a session of this size over a dial-up line. Problem #2 is the case of the browser hanging entirely. It appears that the primary process simply stops talking to the X server. I believe I can provide a stack trace for this (it is long) and may even have the core file. This is some kind of internal logic/function error in chrome. It should be noted that the problem is not with the X server  it works fine for the current gnome session and produces no errors in the log file. But under ideal circumstances I should be able to restart the session both with Javascript and Flash and that is definitely not the case (I've encountered this problem at least 5 times). And as it costs me the better part of an hour each time I run into it -- it definitely doesn't make me a happier person. ",

Chrome uses the same limit for SOCKS proxy servers. My understanding is this limit is desirable to prevent overloading a proxy server (similar to how to use a 6 connection per endpoint host limit). See http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev amp;revision=45896 for the implementation of this. Should we be use a different limit? 15 came from Firefox. Some people (at least pinkerton  with a SOCKS proxy) report issues with http transactions stalling  due to hitting this limit. Do we need to raise this? Also  I'm not sure what Firefox does for SOCKS proxy servers. Do they even have a limit? Do we want to treat HTTP and SOCKS proxy servers differently in terms of connection limits? I don't see a reason to offhand. My personal feeling is we should probably raise the limit from 15 to something like 32 or 64 or something. I said powers of 2 chosen since wtc likes them :P Then we can run A/B experiments to lower the limits and see at what level we can tighten them to  before transactions start stalling (I think we can guesstimate this by seeing the effect on PLT  which will probably increase dramatically for a percentage of users).

Create a very large browser session (hundreds of tabs) 2. Kill the session 3. Restore the session  ? The user should be able to specify what fraction of system resources are available to the browser.  ? Browser uses all resources (CPU  network  memory) available to the detriment of other programs. The user has no ability to control the CPU  network or memory resources used by the browser. In particular  --single-process and --process-per-tab appear to be unimplemented. There are also no switches (or session control preferences) to control (a) the amount of DNS lookup activity taking place (which some ISP's appear to track); (b) the amount of network bandwidth being consumed; (c) the number of web sites with open communications activity simultaneously; (d) the size of the local Google cache; (e) The amount of memory used (except by setting process memory size limits [1]); (f) the load being placed on the CPU(s). Chrome already has (via the task manager interfaces) to monitor many of these aspects of system load (though the task manager interface needs its own system load self-governor  but that is a separate issue). But there is no way to limit CPU use to 50% of the system load or network load to 50% of the maximum network bandwidth  etc. The problem with Issue #32061 and Issue #32165 could be dealt with via a simple  quot;--limit-sites:# quot; switch. This would likely solve both the CPU use and the network bandwidth problem. If chrome only got to talk to 1-2 sites at a time one wouldn't have several hundred spinners  the CPU wouldn't be maxed out and the network bandwidth would not be maxed out for 10 minutes. Developers at Google may live in a world of nearly infinite resources -- but most of the rest of the users in the real world don't. There are some  quot;power quot; users who can run very large sessions (they have 3GB of main memory and ~10 GB of swap space) and who tend to keep large sessions running for weeks (so if they need to be restored there are going to be short-term resource contention issues). But they only have one set of eyes and are probably only looking at 1 window at a time (very few people can read 2 pages simultaneously). What they care about is the window in front of their face and the responsiveness of *THAT* window. If chrome activity on any other window is decreasing the performance of the top (primary) window then the session design has problems. Ensuring limited resource use by the chrome session as a whole ensures that resources are always available to the window in front of ones face [2]. 1. I suspect if process memory limits are set and Chrome hits them it will respond ungraciously -- Firefox has had a 2-3 year outstanding bug regarding nasty failures that occur when memory is constrained. 2. For example  what happens to an incoming Skype call on a DSL line (or worse yet a dial-up line) when one is in the middle of a 15-20 minute Chrome session restore that has maxed the line bandwidth? In theory TCP/IP scheduling is supposed to deal with this -- but in practice I doubt that is the case. In practice  I find that both Music playing and Browser performance (e.g. gmail) suffer whenever I run long system builds (emerges in Gentoo terminology) -- even when I've taken steps to nice -19 or use chrt to change the build priority to only use the idle cycles. I'm sure that chromium session restores would have similar effects. Does chromium have a way of shifting the chrome process state from  quot;idle quot; scheduling (for restoring windows/tabs or inactive (non-viewable) tabs/windows) to  quot;fifo quot; scheduling for the top window (tab)?

The behaviors don't appear to be exactly consistent  but in general: 1. Setting currentTime to a value of  lt; currentTime: - The value of currentTime is set properly - The video returns to position 0 (despite currentTime reflecting the time set) - Playback resumes starting from position 0. Timeupdate events do not fire until the playback position reflected is greater than the value of currentTime (as set). 2. Setting currentTime to a value  gt; currentTime - The value of currentTime is set properly - A timeupdate event is fired at the correct currentTime - Playback resumes from some arbitrary position later in the video (example: if currentTime was set to 15  playback will resume from 22) timeupdate events fire immediately reflecting the later time indices. Whether the video is currently playing or paused doesn't seem to matter. I have tried other videos and don't have this issue; I feel like it may be something to do with *how* this particular video is encoded but I'm not an expert at video codecs. I used the following code as a test in the console (URL removed for simplicity); var url =  quot; quot;; // path to the video var video = document.createElement( quot;video quot;); video.src = url; document.body.appendChild(video) video.play() ...wait for video to play for 10 seconds. video.currentTime = 5; // see error case 1 above video.currentTime = 15; // see error case 2 above 8523_30060000112725_video-utility-h264.mp4 952 KB  nbsp; Download ",

Click on a checking or savings account (requires PIN) - this loads a  quot;enter your PIN quot; page 3. Allow browser to save passwords  ? The password and PIN should be saved separately (they are entered on separate pages). In IE8  the PIN field doesn't get saved (although it might be user error that I accidentally told it not to). In Firefox 3.5.7  both the password and pin are saved fine and if I log out and repeat the steps  the password is filled in the password field fine and the pin is filled in the pin field fine.  ? The browser doesn't seem to understand these are 2 separate fields (perhaps because they're both type=password?). After letting the browser save the initial password  it's filled in for the PIN field on the later page. When then correcting and typing in the correct PIN (which has a different number of characters in my case  so it's easy to tell which is getting filled in)  then after logging out and logging back in  the PIN value is what's pre- populated in the password field.

We then got sign-off from mmentovai and others. Changes will happen in a series of phases: 1. The existing .gyp files will be modified so that 2 different .sln files can be generated  gated on gyp defines (a 32-bit and a 64-bit sln). Initially the 64-bit sln will be basically empty. These slns will output their intermediate files into separate directories (possibly intermingled Debug/x64/... etc)  they will share a common output directory (chrome/Debug  chrome/Release etc). Ideally  this will share a lot in common with the linux64 conditionals. 2. gyp_chromium will be modified so that on windows  gyp will be invoked twice  once for 32/64  so folks will get both SLNs on checkout. 3. compile.py will be altered on the bots  so that both SLNs get built. This will require two invocations of devenv. 4. Targets will be migrated from the current crazy 'target_defaults' / includes gypi approach to something that resembles the way linux 32 v 64 is handled (with only the nacl shim building initially). 5. As 64-bit versions of some tests become available  extra invocations of those tests will be added to the bots. 6. Gyp will be modified so that on supported generators (msvs  possibly make as well)  GenerateOutput can accept multiple [target_list  target_dicts  data  params] (produced by varying GYP_DEFINES and re-running all input processing). On these generators  these alternate configurations will be collapsed together into a single Makefile/sln vcproj  in which alternate platforms can be selected. For make  this should be close to trival (though possibly undesirable  mmoss?). For msvs  it will effectively allow whole targets to be gated out by config  and will enable alternate exclude lists per config. (Note at this point two builds are still required to build everything  but they can at least be done from the same sln/makefile  which avoids angering the msvs editor.) - While this does strictly speaking add functionality to some generators absent on others  there is still a moral equivalent in xcode (generate multiple side by side projects). Also  this approach has the advantage that nothing needs to be added to gyp syntax. It will double gyp runtime  which I assume does not matter. ",

The target architecture is chosen in Xcode via build settings. There can be no knowledge of architecture at GYP .xcodeproj generation time. As a precursor to a full proper 64-bit build  host_arch and target_arch in GYP need to be changed. Currently on the Mac  they\u9225\u6a99e set to \u9225\u6e0ba32\u9225? This should change to \u9225\u6e15ac\u9225?as a pseudo-architecture  and an indication that something special is going on. Some .gyp files will need to be adjusted to recognize the new host_arch.

You attempted to reach www1.pbxes.com  but the certificate that the server presented has been revoked by its issuer. This means that the security credentials the server presented absolutely should not be trusted. You may be communicating with an attacker. You should not proceed. Help me understand When you connect to a secure website  the server hosting that site presents your browser with something called a  quot;certificate quot; to verify its identity. This certificate contains identity information  such as the address of the website  which is verified by a third party that your computer trusts. By checking that the address in the certificate matches the address of the website  it is possible to verify that you are securely communicating with the website you intended  and not a third party (such as an attacker on your network). In this case  the certificate presented to your browser has been revoked by its issuer. This usually means that the integrity of this certificate has been compromised  and that the certificate should not be trusted. You absolutely should not proceed past this point. ---------------------- My timezone and system time are correct so it's not the nss timezone bug filed elsewhere. ",

Longer version: Chromium creates new SiteInstances when the user navigates to a different web site via the browser process (e.g.  omnibox  bookmark  etc). This gets tricky if the navigation redirects to a different web site than the user typed in. Currently  we wait to assign a SiteInstance to a site until DidNavigate  so that we wait until all the redirects are finished. This creates opportunities for races  where two different renderers in the same BrowsingInstance could be used for the same site (which could break JavaScript calls between pages). We already have to create special cases for session restore and DOM UI pages to avoid such races. (See RenderViewHostManager::GetSiteInstanceForEntry.) We should refactor the SiteInstance logic to better handle redirects. We should assume the typed URL will be correct (optimistically firing up a process if needed)  but we should be able to switch to an existing renderer process if the navigation redirects to a site that's already open in the BrowsingInstance. If possible  we should also eagerly assign SiteInstances to simplify the logic. (Note that separating SiteInstance logic from process logic may help with this. See issue 11629 .) Another reason we are lazy about assigning a SiteInstance to a site is because the navigation could be a download. If we change to an eager approach  we should try to allow an unused (blank) renderer to still be used even if a download has occurred. ",

We need to kill the en.lproj - gt; en_US.lproj symbolic link in our package. Ideally we'd do something special and output en.lproj instead of en_US.lproj. Symbolic links aren't included in the code signature. Having en.lproj be a symbolic link makes it possible to replace all theme.pak resources for English users that haven't selected a more specific locale without altering the application's fingerprint. Doing so is as simple as retargeting the symbolic link to point elsewhere. This is a security problem to some extent. I've removed all other symbolic links from our .app package. en.lproj is the only one that remains (although it's present in three places). ",

Set the time to 09:00 d. select '\u9796\u534a\u646b\u74ff\u72be\u5540' (3rd choice) for '\u970c\u6807\u7b01' e. for '\u6bf5\u308c\u57ac' (# of passengers)  set '\u978f\u63aa\u30b8' (adult) to 1 and leave '\u978e\u52f2\u5f4a'(child) alone f. click the orange button ('\u9780\u8f68\u7691\u7513?\u9793\u5828\u66af/\u9793\u5827\u0413') 3. When a pop-up box pops up with terms and conditions  press enter or click the default choice ('Ok' - approve) 4. In the body of the next page  there will be two tables. The first table lists the bus schedule matching the criteria selected in step 2. 4th column is # of available seats('\u979b\u65cd\u68f3\u81a6\u5c87\u5283') and 5th column has '\u9779\u72bf\u5129' (select) button. 5. Click '\u9779\u72bf\u5129'(select) button in one of rows with seats available less than 28. 6. Click 'OK' (the default choice) for two pop-up boxes that show up in sequence What's expected: - It's possible to tell available seats from seats already taken by a slight difference in color. Actual: It's impossible to tell the difference. Safari  Chrome (on Mac OS X) and the default browser on Adroid have this problem while Fireofx 3.5 on Mac OS X does not. So  it's likely to be a webkit issue and has to be reported in the upstream. ",

If you have trouble reproducing  just let me know and I can try to get a more precise test case. In messing around with HTTP digest authentication  I discovered a behavior where the password manager pre-populates the login form for one domain with the credentials for *another domain*. It doesn't submit them automatically  but does leave the user one click away from sending credentials to the wrong place. Here are the steps I followed on Chrome 3.0.195.38 under Windows 7 (release candidate): 0. Set up an HTML page with the following contents:  lt;html gt; lt;body gt;  lt;img src= quot; http://evil.example.com/image.png  quot; / gt;  lt;/body gt; lt;/html gt; This page should be hosted at (not protected by any auth): http://victim.example.org/test-img.html 1. Next  set up an HTTP digest protected area under the following URL: http://victim.example.org/private/ 2. Now set up the attacker's server to be digest protected  so that the following URL should prompt for digest auth: http://evil.example.com/image.png 3. Log in to a digest-protected area such as: http://victim.example.org/private Save the password in the password manager. 4. Now  access the unauthenticated HTML page on the victim's server: http://victim.example.org/test-img.html Since the embedded image requires authentication  you should get a password prompt. The vulnerability I encountered is that the password manager actually prepopulates victim.example.org's credentials in this dialog. In message board websites  or anywhere that an attacker can post links to images on third party sites  this could be a serious phishing issue. No other browser I tested does this. With digest authentication  this isn't the end of the world since passwords aren't that easy to get at  but I would be surprised if basic authentication prompts don't have the same behavior. I was doing some general security testing on many browsers when I came across this issue. I have some additional observations about security weaknesses in this area which affect many browsers that I'll be publishing in a week or so. I will drop a link somewhere here when I get it out and I hope some of your devs will have a chance to review it. thanks! ",
