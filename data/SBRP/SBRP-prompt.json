This is problematic because the untrusted page might not actually sanitize HTML. Proof of concept: http://crypto.stanford.edu/~abarth/research/chromium/inspectored/ This vulnerability seems harder to exploit in TOT WebKit with SquirrelFish Extreme due to some odd semantics around __defineGetter__. This will get fixed in the Great Inspector Rearchitecting  so it's not clear whether we should try to fix this issue as a one-off.\nCategory:SBR\n###\nBug report: Issue 11116 : task leak in ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease in ui_tests 1 person starred this issue and may be notified of changes.    nbsp;   dank@chromium.org    On the valgrind ui bot  I'm seeing task leaks like this: 16 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost: at operator new(unsigned int) (vg_replace_malloc.c:195) by ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease() (child_thread.cc:116) by ChildProcess::ReleaseProcess() (child_process.cc:53) by RenderWidget::~RenderWidget() (render_widget.cc:72) by RenderView::~RenderView() (render_view.cc:220) by RenderWidget::Release() (ref_counted.h:80) That line is owner_loop_- gt;PostTask(FROM_HERE  new MessageLoop::QuitTask()); which makes me wonder a bit... if that message isn't causing the message loop to quit  what is?\nCategory:SBR\n###\nBug report: \"\"\"{}\"\"\"\nCategory:"

These reports help developers and security experts to analyze, prioritize, and fix security-related issues in a timely manner, ensuring the safety and integrity of the software and its users. Key features of security bug reports include:\n\n1. Identification of security vulnerabilities: SBRs highlight potential security risks, such as memory leaks, improper handling of user input, or insufficient access controls, which could be exploited by attackers to compromise the system or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\n2. Detailed analysis: Security bug reports provide a thorough analysis of the issue, including steps to reproduce the problem, the expected and actual outcomes, and any relevant error messages or logs. This information helps developers understand the root cause of the issue and develop appropriate fixes.\n\n3. Severity assessment: SBRs often include an assessment of the severity of the security issue, taking into account factors such as the potential impact on users, the ease of exploitation, and the likelihood of an attack. This helps prioritize the resolution of security issues and allocate resources accordingly.\n\n4. Recommendations for mitigation or resolution: Security bug reports may include suggestions for fixing the issue, such as applying patches, updating libraries, or modifying code to address the vulnerability. These recommendations help developers implement effective solutions to resolve the security issue and prevent future occurrences.\n\n5. Ongoing monitoring and updates: As new security threats emerge and software systems evolve, security bug reports may be updated to reflect the latest information and ensure that the software remains secure and up-to-date. This ongoing monitoring helps maintain the overall security posture of the system and protect users from emerging threats.\n---------\nI will give you a bug report and you will analyze it to know whether or not it is a security bug report.
