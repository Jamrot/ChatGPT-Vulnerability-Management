Load a page with windowed plugin (diamondx or flash) 2. Use xwininfo to see the tree of windows involved 3. Scroll the page 4. Note that we're creating more and more windows Dean made a test plugin on Windows that shows that Firefox doesn't call SetWindow when you scroll. On Linux  us doing this causes this terrible leak. I will investigate deciding when it's appropriate to call SetWindow.\nCategory:SBR\n###\nBug report: Issue 16841 : Mem leak with IPC::Channel::Channel() in unit_tests UtilityProcessHostTest.ExtensionUnpacker under Valgrind on Mac 1 person starred this issue and may be notified of changes.    nbsp;   nirnimesh@chromium.org    rafelw  your r20748 has introduced a mem leak in unit_tests under Valgrind on Mac.

This is problematic because the untrusted page might not actually sanitize HTML. Proof of concept: http://crypto.stanford.edu/~abarth/research/chromium/inspectored/ This vulnerability seems harder to exploit in TOT WebKit with SquirrelFish Extreme due to some odd semantics around __defineGetter__. This will get fixed in the Great Inspector Rearchitecting  so it's not clear whether we should try to fix this issue as a one-off.\nCategory:SBR\n###\nBug report: Issue 11116 : task leak in ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease in ui_tests 1 person starred this issue and may be notified of changes.    nbsp;   dank@chromium.org    On the valgrind ui bot  I'm seeing task leaks like this: 16 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost: at operator new(unsigned int) (vg_replace_malloc.c:195) by ChildThread::OnProcessFinalRelease() (child_thread.cc:116) by ChildProcess::ReleaseProcess() (child_process.cc:53) by RenderWidget::~RenderWidget() (render_widget.cc:72) by RenderView::~RenderView() (render_view.cc:220) by RenderWidget::Release() (ref_counted.h:80) That line is owner_loop_- gt;PostTask(FROM_HERE  new MessageLoop::QuitTask()); which makes me wonder a bit... if that message isn't causing the message loop to quit  what is?\nCategory:SBR\n###\nBug report: \"\"\"{}\"\"\"\nCategory:"
