These functions may include operations such as modifying queue pair attributes, allocating memory with user data, handling ioctl for user data, or managing metadata internally. Functions that deal with user data or require user input are also considered as Required.\n\nFunctions that map to the Not Required value of the CVSS UI metric are those that do not involve user interaction or have a direct impact on the user experience. These functions typically handle internal operations, hardware configuration, or low-level data processing. Examples include setting up default capabilities, enabling or disabling specific features, initializing hardware components, or performing calculations and conversions. Functions that deal with internal states, hardware settings, or are part of the system's background operations are considered as Not Required.\n------\nI will provide a function, and you will map the appropriate CVSS UI metric value to the function.
