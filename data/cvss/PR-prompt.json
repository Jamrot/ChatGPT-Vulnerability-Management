These functions are typically related to general operations, hardware management, data processing, and other non-sensitive tasks.\n\nExamples of Not High value functions include:\n- Remove target from visibility on last reap ref put\n- Initializes and allocates sigmadsp instance, loads firmware, returns pointer\n- Handler for lport timeout retry work timer\n- Maps card memory to virtual space with ops mutex held\n- Helper function for accessing ALC coefficient index\n- Maps proximity ID to nearest online node, handles offline nodes, used by ACPI device drivers for obtaining device NUMA topology\n- Checks for message from PF to VF\n- Clears bit in local doorbell register for next doorbell\n- Count qdio buffer elements for skb transmission\n- Sanity check for new bestfree entry in XFS dir2 data\n------\nI will provide a function, and you will map the appropriate CVSS PR metric value to the function.
