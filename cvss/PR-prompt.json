These functions are critical in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the system and its data.\n\nExamples of High value functions include:\n- Nested VMX instruction permission check\n- Special permission handler for proc fd access after setuid execution\n- Security framework initialization\n- Smack inode security ID extraction\n- Permission check for Apex ioctls\n- SELinux xfrm postroute last hook for security association checking\n- Check kill permission for signal sender with RCU read lock\n- AppArmor socket getpeername permission check\n- Capable function for determining task's effective capability\n- Inode owner or capable check for permission based on owner or capability\n\nFunctions that map to the Not High value of the CVSS PR metric are those that do not directly involve security-related operations or permission checks. These functions are typically related to general operations, hardware management, data processing, and other non-sensitive tasks.\n\nExamples of Not High value functions include:\n- Remove target from visibility on last reap ref put\n- Initializes and allocates sigmadsp instance, loads firmware, returns pointer\n- Handler for lport timeout retry work timer\n- Maps card memory to virtual space with ops mutex held\n- Helper function for accessing ALC coefficient index\n- Maps proximity ID to nearest online node, handles offline nodes, used by ACPI device drivers for obtaining device NUMA topology\n- Checks for message from PF to VF\n- Clears bit in local doorbell register for next doorbell\n- Count qdio buffer elements for skb transmission\n- Sanity check for new bestfree entry in XFS dir2 data\n------\nI will provide a function, and you will map the appropriate CVSS PR metric value to the function.
