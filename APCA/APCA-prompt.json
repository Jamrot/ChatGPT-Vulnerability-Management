The problem comes from the fact that when  ser is null , the new ser returned by _findAndAddDynamic is incorrectly filled.  So say we are in  ser#1 , ser#1._dynamicSerializers now has the correct PropertySerializerMap$Single . However, result.serializer._dynamicSerializers has PropertySerializerMap$Empty . Therefore, a new call with that result ser#2 is made which ends up creating an infinite loop. Possible fix:    replace  If I'm mistaken please let me know, but It seems obvious when debugging that something's is not working as intended\nPatch: Added fix for Object . toString ( ).\nCategory: CoF\n###\n{}\nCategory:"
